# NYPD 911 Shots 

This is my analysis of the NYPD 911 dataset found here: [911 End-to-End Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/911-End-to-End-Data/t7p9-n9dy/data)

This dataset is comprised of all incidents where 911 was called for all matters whether they're urgent or not. In this analysis, I concentrated on all serious and critical 911 calls where the caller either reported a "shots fired" situation or if the sound of gunshots triggered NYPDs Shotspotter technology.
