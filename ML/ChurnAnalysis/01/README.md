# Churn Analysis 01
For my final project I decided to do a Churn analysis for a major fictional company. My goal with this project was to investigate the source of why the churn is so high for this company. In case that you’re not familiar with what customer churn is, churn is a prominent problem in today’s business. This problem primarily persists in credit card companies, cable service providers, and telecommunication companies. My main intention is to find why customers are leaving and try to find ways of retaining the customers we have. In this case, we will use data mining to predict which customers will stay and which customers will likely leave for another service. 
After doing research in churn analysis primarily in the telecommunications sector, I realized that telecommunication companies use substantial amounts of data to attempt to resolve this issue.
